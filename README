logen - logic signal generator
=============================

logen is a basic testing logic signal generator for testing logic gates and
their responses to different signals. It generates every possible pattern of
logic symbols on n pins by simply counting up in binary and outputting the
result onto the configured pins.

Usage Instructions
------------------

Hook up the pins you have configured to some kind of output (logic, LED, etc.)
and watch the signals!

To freeze the board on a particular bit pattern, pull BTN_PIN low (on many
boards, this means press the built-in button). Assuming this input is connected
to a button, press once shortly to unfreeze again. Long pressing when frozen
will shift to the next logic state but remain frozen. If BTN_PIN is not
connected to a button, the same timing applies to the input logic signal.

Practically all inputs are active low.

Dependencies
------------

To build, you probably need one of the support packs from Atmel. The makefile
assumes you put them in the same place I put them on my system (which is really
unlikely), so be sure to configure the BOARDLIBS parameter properly on your
system.

If you installed them globally, you can set the BOARDLIBS parameter to an empty
string and the AVRLIBS one will pick them up, assuming they are in the default
AVR libraries path.

Hardware support
----------------

In theory, anything AVR which supports programs compiled directly to the metal
with no Arduino runtime etc.

I wrote this for the ATTiny3217, so I can attest to the fact that it runs
perfectly on that specific controller, but you can consider it otherwise
untested.

You *will* need to configure for your board, unless you happen to be using an
ATTiny3217 on a Curiosity Nano 3 port, 7 pin board with LED on PB3 and button
on PA7!

Configuration
-------------

All build-time configuration can be passed on the command line to the makefile.
For instance, say you need to compile using AVR Clang targetting ATTiny10,
flash using minipro and use /dev/ttyACM0 as the flasher target, you could use
the following:

	make CC=avr-clang FLASHER=minipro BOARD=attiny10 BOARDPORT=/dev/ttyACM0

If this is too clumsy or you want persistence, you can create a shell script to
export the environment variables yourself:

	export CC=avr-clang FLASHER=minipro BOARD=attiny10 BOARDPORT=/dev/ttyACM0

Then, just save to a file and source it (not execute! that won't work!):

	$ source ./buildenv


Software configuration is done entirely through constants in config.h. Very
little error checking is performed as I assume that you know what you are doing
with the hardware. BUT, obvious errors (such as overflowing a register or
specifying pins that don't exist on AVR boards) will cause the board to halt at
startup and flash the internal LED (if one exists) on LED_PORT's LED_PIN.

If your specific hardware does not support some or all of the features, most
can be disabled by just ignoring their existence. However, you can disable
panic LED flashes by setting PANIC_ENABLE to zero.

If SINGLE_STEP is set to 1, the program waits for BTN_PIN to go low each cycle
before moving on to the next logic state. This is for use on built-in buttons
on many boards, otherwise can be used to sync to an inverted clock pulse.

INTERVAL is a vague number capped at UINT16_MAX which controls the delay
between logic cycles. The higher the longer the delay, the lower the shorter.
It is not more specific than that and is deliberately inprecise.
